# A List Report Object Page App with SAP Fiori Tools
I have used SAP Fiori tools to create an app featuring a list of objects, with additional pages that provide more detailed information about the items in the list.

I have used Visual Studio Code as the IDE with SAP Fiori Tools extension pack. For the backend I have used mock data connecting to my SAP Gateway - Demo System (ES5).

Things that I have learned:

1. The Application Generator provides a wizard-style approach to generating projects based on SAP Fiori elements page types.

2. Guided Development walks through adding new features.

3. Service Modeler enables to visualize the backend service and its associated annotations.

4. XML Annotation Language Server helps to add and edit local annotations in code editor directly.

5. Page Map visualizes the structure of the pages in the app, as well as allows to easily create additional pages.

6. All of these tools can be used with any of the available SAP Fiori elements page types.
